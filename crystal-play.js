    //Scene 1
"Narrator: (All four stand at the edge of the temple's central chamber.)",
"Captain Obvious: Well, here we are. ... Standing at the exact location, where the map said the crystal would be. That must be it,  on the pedestal. Because, you know, it’s glowing.",
"Sarcastic Sally: Oh wow, really? I just thought we were here for the ambiance. Who doesn’t love a death trap lit by ancient mood lighting?",
"Optimistic Otto: Isn’t this amazing? We’ve come so far as a team! I’m sure we’ll get the crystal and become even better friends!",
// (stepping forward grandly)
"Megalomaniac Marvin (stepping forward grandly): Yes, I have led us well. Soon, the Crystal shall be mine, and with it, I shall ascend beyond your puny mortal limitations!",
// (pointing)
"Captain Obvious (pointing): Careful ... those tiles are pressure-sensitive. If you step on the wrong one, you’ll trigger a trap. Probably arrows. Or spikes. Or snakes.",
"Sarcastic Sally: Oh, thank goodness you warned us. I was absolutely about to dance across them in a conga line.",
"Optimistic Otto: Don’t worry! If we work together, we’ll find the safe path. Maybe there's a pattern. Like hopscotch! Who doesn't love hopscotch?",
// (ignores them, steps forward confidently)
"Megalomaniac Marvin (ignores them, steps forward confidently): I fear no trap! The universe bends to my will!",
"Narrator: (He steps on a tile. CLICK. Arrows fly from the walls. He ducks ... barely.)",
"Captain Obvious: That was almost dangerous. Good thing you ducked. Otherwise, you might have been hit. By arrows.",
"Sarcastic Sally: Oh yeah, he’s totally in control of the universe. I mean, what’s a few death darts to a supreme being?",
"Optimistic Otto: But hey ... you survived! That means we’re one step closer! Great job, Marvin!",
// (brushing himself off)
"Megalomaniac Marvin (brushing himself off): Of course. It was... a test. I passed. As expected.",
//"Scene 2",
"Narrator: (They reach the pedestal. The crystal glows brightly.)",
"Captain Obvious: There it is. The Crystal of Clarity. It's clear. And also... made of crystal.",
"Sarcastic Sally: Wow. I had no idea the Crystal of Clarity would be so... crystal clear. Mind. Blown.",
"Optimistic Otto: It’s beautiful! Just think what we can learn from it! Maybe we can solve all the world’s problems!",
// (lunging toward it)
"Megalomaniac Marvin (lunging toward it): And I shall use it to bend the world to my will! Nations shall kneel! Clouds will form in my likeness!",
"Captain Obvious: You should probably not touch it until we’re sure it’s safe. Because touching ancient glowing artifacts is usually what triggers the worst part of these adventures.",
"Sarcastic Sally: But what’s life without a little impulsive world domination and ancient curses?",
"Optimistic Otto: Maybe it’s enchanted to reward teamwork! Maybe if we all touch it together, it’ll share the wisdom with everyone!",
"Megalomaniac Marvin: Never! I alone shall wield its power!",
"Narrator: (He grabs the crystal. A massive pulse of light knocks him backward. He lands in a heap, dazed.)",
"Captain Obvious: Looks like it had a defense mechanism. Possibly to prevent power-hungry maniacs from using it selfishly.",
"Sarcastic Sally: Oh no. How unexpected. A booby-trapped relic actually trapped someone. Groundbreaking twist.",
"Optimistic Otto: But Marvin’s okay! And now we know: it needs all of us! Isn’t that a beautiful metaphor?",
"Captain Obvious: If we all reach out now, at the same time, we may activate its true potential. Because that’s how cooperative puzzles usually work.",
"Sarcastic Sally: Ugh, fine. Let’s hold hands and sing kumbaya while we’re at it.",
"Narrator: (They all reach for the crystal. Light envelops them. The room hums with energy. The Crystal pulses ... then quiets.)",
"Captain Obvious: We did it. We activated the crystal. Together.",
"Optimistic Otto: I knew we could do it! This is the best day ever!",
"Sarcastic Sally: Yay. Group bonding and ancient enlightenment. My two favorite things.",

"Megalomaniac Marvin (groggily): Fine... perhaps I shall share power... temporarily...",
